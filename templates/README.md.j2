# {{ full\_role\_name }}

A brief description of the role goes here.

## Requirements

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role
should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module,
it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package
is required.

## Role Variables

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here,
including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml,
and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any
variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie.
hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

## Dependencies

A list of other roles hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details
in regards to parameters that may need to be set for other roles, or
variables that are used from other roles.

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with
variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

``` yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
  - role: {{ full_role_name }}
```

## Testing

This role provides a `Vagrantfile` and a `Makefile`.

``` bash
# Makefile-provided commands
$ make help
help                This help message
lint                Test YAML syntax
vagrant-destroy     Destroy vagrant boxes
vagrant-variables   Test vagrant env variables
vagrant-vbox        Test the playbook using vagrant and virtualbox
# Mandatory variables

# Optionnal variables
$ export VAGRANT_BOX_URL="http://repo/my-box.box"
